        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max were officially announced alongside the 9th generation iPad, 6th
            generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini by a virtual press event filmed and
            recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17 at
            5:00 AM PST. Pricing starts at US$999 for the iPhone 13 Pro and US$1099 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, same as
            their respective previous generations.[16]</p>

        <hr>
        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max's design is mostly unchanged from its predecessor. However, the rear
            camera module now covers a larger area due to the larger lenses. The Face ID and camera module on the front
            display, or "notch", is now 20% smaller than previous generations.[17]

            The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are available in five colors: Silver, Graphite, Gold, Sierra Blue, and
            Alpine Green. Sierra Blue is a new color replacing Pacific Blue.[10][18]

            On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Alpine Green color
            option, which became available on March 18.[19][20]

        <h4 id="hardware">Hardware <a href="#">[edit]</a></h4>
        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max uses an Apple-designed A15 Bionic processor featuring a 16-core neural engine,
            6-core CPU (with 2 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores), and 5-core GPU.[21] The A15 Bionic also
            contains a next-generation image processor.[citation needed]

            More 5G bands are available to support more carriers, especially outside the US.[citation needed]</p>
        <h4 id="display">Display <a href="#">[edit]</a></h4>
        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro features a 6.1-inch 1170 x 2532 pixel display and the larger iPhone 13 Pro Max features a
            6.7-inch 1284 x 2778 pixel display. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical
            brightness up-to 1000 nits, and max brightness up-to 1200 nits, and for the first time in an iPhone, a
            variable 10-120 Hz ProMotion display, which can also go as low as 10 Hz to preserve battery and the term was
            previously used on the iPad Pro (2nd Generation) and later models.[15]</p>
        <h4 id="batteries">batteries <a href="#">[edit]</a></h4>
        <p>Apple claims up to 1.5 more hours of battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro than its predecessor, and 2.5 more
            hours on the 13 Pro Max. Rated capacities are 11.97 Wh (3,095 mAh) on the 13 Pro, while the 13 Pro Max is
            rated at 16.75 Wh (4,352 mAh).[22][23] Both models can charge with MagSafe up to 15 W, Qi wireless charging
            up to 7.5 W, and Lightning up to 20-27 W for the (Pro Max), 20-23 W For the (Pro).[24]</p>
        <h4 id="cameras">camera <a href="#">[edit]</a></h4>
        <p>The iPhone 13 Pro features four cameras: one front-facing camera and three back-facing cameras, including a
            telephoto, wide, and ultra-wide camera. The back-facing cameras all contain larger sensors than the iPhone
            12 Pro, allowing for more light-gathering. The wide and ultra-wide also have larger apertures to capture
            more light and increase low-light performance. The ultra-wide camera also has autofocus for the first time.
            The 77 mm telephoto has a smaller aperture than the 12 Pro's, but has the advantage of being able to use
            Night Mode for the first time. The larger telephoto also increases the digital zoom capability to 15x.[15]

            The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Smart HDR 4 processes
            recognized faces in photos separately using local adjustments. Users can also choose from a range of
            photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this
            is different than a filter, because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during
            capture to apply local adjustments to an image.[25]

            The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects
            and create shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on the wide, telephoto and
            front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps. Apple also added in iOS 15.1 the ability to record in Apple ProRes
            4K at 30 fps for models with at least 256 GB of storage, however base models with 128 GB of storage will be
            limited to ProRes recording at 1080p 30 fps.[26]

            The camera features a macro mode that can focus as close as 2 centimeters from a subject. It utilizes the
            autofocus from the ultra-wide camera, and is automatically enabled when close enough to a subject.[27]</p>
